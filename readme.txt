Software currently for windows32 systems only.

All radios that have an RTS pin PTT serial cable are compatible (most are).
VOX may also work in some cases.

Just set the serial port, the delay between transmissions and fire it up, you should keep your volume about 1/4 of the way up however more adjustments may be required.

Note that the quality of the radio and sound card will affect your performance, example my baofeng wont work at all, my wouxun wont do anything under 100hz and my iCom will do the whole PL band.
Give it a try, and have fun with it.

NOTE: I am NOT responsible for what you do with this, stay off systems your not supposed to be on.
